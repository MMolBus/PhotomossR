\title{chart.2:  Manual selection of points where color checker tiles are located in
the image.}
\usage{
chart.2(
  pic.path,
  samp.width = 0.01,
  pic.format,
  xriteclassic.chart = T,
  n.color.tiles
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pic.path}{string. File path where you can find the image files.}

\item{samp.width}{numeric. Distance from original click point to establish 
the perimeter of the new geometry. Of length 1 replicated to the number of 
input click points, or of length equal to the number of click points.}

\item{pic.format}{character. Picture file format. It could be "jpg" for .jpg,
.JPG and .jpeg; or "tif", for .tif format.}

\item{xriteclassic.chart}{logical. Indicates if we are using 24 color tiles 
from Xrite classic ColorCheker to make the color calibration. Default = TRUE. 
If FALSE (you are not using Xrite classic ColorCheker, or you want to use 
another quantity of color tiles) you need to provide the number of tiles 
you would use in the n.color.tiles parameter}

\item{n.color.tiles}{numeric. Only required if you would not use 24 color tiles 
from Xrite Classic ColorCheker to make the color calibration. In that case 
you need to provide the number of tiles (n) you would use in your color chart to 
make the color calibration.}
}
\value{
A spatial.polygon with 24 features one by each color tile in case 
xriteclassic.chart = T, or n features if xriteclassic.chart = F and n.color.tiles = n.
}
\description{
Manual selection of points where color checker tiles are located in the image.
You need to click over color tiles in the opened window where you can find 
the picture with the color chart. 
To click over the tiles you need to follow the order shown in
\href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMolBus/photomoss/master/vignettes/vignette_Photomoss_workflow/chart.png}{this image}.
Preferably, click on the color tile centroids.
