\# Image pre-processing:

We use ImageJ macro scripts to align each pair of NIR-VIS images and to
homogenize color histograms. You could download Image J in
<https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html> We use ImageJ because it is
open-source, very accessible and familiar in biological sciences,
fitting with our main goal of develop an accessible protocol.

\#\# Alignment:

Allow NIR-VIS pictures perfectly match for *Photomoss* index calculation
and homogenization reduces exposure differences between images.

\#\# Histogram homogenization:

We select one image from each NIR/VIS series to use it as histogram
reference to match the rest of histograms from its series.
