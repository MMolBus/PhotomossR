## Image pre-processing:

A **ImageJ** macro repository providing tools to paired images alignment and histogram matching within a picture series. 
We use ImageJ because it is open-source, very accessible and familiar in biological sciences, fitting with our main goal to develop an free and accessible protocol.

**Note**: You can download ImageJ in <https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html>

### Alignment:

Allow NIR-VIS pictures perfectly match for *Photomoss* index calculation
and homogenization reduces exposure differences between images. You could download imj macro file:
* [**Alignment_Process_Folder_v1.ijm**](https://github.com/mossmusgo/photomoss/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_ImageJ_preprocessing/Alignment_Process_Folder_v1.ijm).

### Histogram homogenization:

We select one image from each NIR/VIS series to use it as histogram
reference to match the rest of histograms from its series. You could download imj macro file:
* [**Histomatch_Process_Folder.ijm**](https://github.com/mossmusgo/photomoss/blob/master/vignettes/vignette_ImageJ_preprocessing/Histomatch_Process_Folder.ijm).
