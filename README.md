# Photomoss
Set of R functions to calculate biological cover in Bilogical Soil Crusts by imaging, based on mosscoder/crustCover.
This package is the data processing backbone of a whole data retrieving and analysis protocol that offers a research tool to work with Biological Soil Crusts.
Full protocol involves image retrieval and pre-processing,  calculation of spectral indices and binary segmentation. 
Finally, the user can conduct quality test of obtained results, comparing calculated area with baseline cuts of the processed images.
Whole process is supported by a combination of cheap modified drone cameras and built-for-purpose, ImageJ macros and the R package, _Photomoss_.
